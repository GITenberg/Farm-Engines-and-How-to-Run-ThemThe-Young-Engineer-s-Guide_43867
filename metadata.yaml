description: An illustrated guide that will intrigue history buffs, small-scale farmers,
  and armchair agriculturalists alike. Originally published in the early 1900s, this
  classic, comprehensive handbook was referred to by young engineers as they prepared
  for their licensing examinations. In addition to several hundred questions and answers
  that were given as part of many exams, Farm Engines and How to Run Them fully describes
  every part of a farm engine and boiler, giving complete directions for the safe
  and economical management of both. Included are chapters on farm engine economy?with
  special attention to traction and gasoline farm engines?and a chapter on the science
  of successful threshing. The book abounds with precision artwork and cutaway illustrations
  showing the different parts of a boiler and engine, and nearly every make of traction
  engine?including those made by Case, Nichols and Shepard, and Buffalo Pitts. Farm
  Engines and How to Run Them will appeal to everyone from farm and vehicle enthusiasts
  to students of industrial technology and agricultural history. 75 b/w illustrations
